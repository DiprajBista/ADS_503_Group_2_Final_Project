<ins>**Background**</ins>
<br/>
Netflix, the leading streaming platform has become hyperfocused on growing its global subscriber base in recent years (Seitz, 2024). The inclusion of original content from foreign countries has increased the already huge streaming library of classic and modern-era movies and TV shows. At the end of 2021, Netlix posted 221.84 million total subscribers (Dean, 2024). Netflix has a significant presence in the streaming industry and their stock price might be a fruitful purchase for investors. <br/><br/>
	At the end of January 2022, 27.7% of at home entertainment consumers primarily used a streaming service, 37.3% of consumers used cable, 26.1% of consumers used broadcast, and 8.9% of consumers used an alternative (Duarte, 2024). At the same point in time, Netflix held a 6.6% total market share of at home entertainment, YouTube held a 5.7% total market share, Hulu held a 3% total market share, Amazon Video held a 2.4% total market share, and Disney+ held a total 1.8% total market share (Duarte, 2024). As cable cutters become more and more popular, Netflix is positioned to be the biggest beneficiary of consumers based on an ongoing growing global presence and current the favorite streaming service due to a large number of well received original content. <br/><br/>

This project aims to analyze historical Netflix stock data and build a robust machine learning model to predict the future stock price. The dataset includes significant historical information such as the daily market open price, close price, adjusted closing prices, daily low, daily high, and daily volume.
